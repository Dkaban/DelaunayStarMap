# Star Brightness Detector
This project is about taking a Hubble image, finding the brightest stars, then creating a delaunay mapping them.

### About
- Currently loads in starImage.jpg
- Runs through the pixels in the image, detecting pixels that are greater than (245,245,245)
- Adds them to an ArrayList and then creates a square image on that pixel.

### Example
